unfortunately we need to patch configure instead of acinclude.m4
as running autoconf will lead to gnupg being flagged as dev release

./gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.4.7-unknown
libgcrypt 1.11.0
NOTE: THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION!
It is only intended for test purposes and should NOT be
used in a production environment or with production keys!

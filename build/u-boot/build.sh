    # This is pretty horrible. U-Boot supports cross compilation for the

    # native tools that are needed for the build, and then rebuild
    # the tools. KBUILD_NOCMDDEP overrides the make system's desire to rebuild
    # everything because the build flags have changed which would result in
    # the tools required for parts of the build being built for the target
    # system and no longer runnable.
